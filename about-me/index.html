    <h1>About me (mr rainy)</h1>
    <p>hi! so u can call me rainy (he/they) and I really love a lot of stuff.</p>
    <h2>Linux n' That</h2>
    <p>I really like Linux. I started daily driving Linux Mint when I was 16 and it's been a fun journey ever since. I've been distro-hopping a lot since so I won't list what distros I'm on currently to avoid dating this section but some of my favorites include CachyOS (Arch Derivative), NixOS, and Linux Mint. There are tons of reasons to get into Linux that you can find online so if you haven't and are interested in software at all, I recommend looking into it.</p>
    <h2>Free and Open-Source</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy open source software and use it when I can. I am a member of the Free Software Foundation, an initiative that aims to supplement and grow free and open-source software as much as possible. My projects are primarily hosted on Codeberg or my personal Forgejo instance. I self-host a Matrix server as a part of my homelab as well.</p>
    <h2>Self-Host/Sysadmin</h2>
    <p>I've been pursuing self-hosting as a hobby ever since 2023, when I installed Jellyfin onto a Raspberry Pi. Since then, I've upgraded to a Dell Optiplex as my homeserver, and have hosted some different silly things :3</p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>I love listening to music, so much in fact, that most of this website was written while listening to some lol :3. I really enjoy genres including post metal, post rock, heavy metal, sludge metal, doom metal, industrial, techno, and more.</p>
    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p>I tend to stick to strategy and racing games of various subgenres. My current favorite game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/473770/BallisticNG/">BallisticNG</a>, a tough-as-nails anti-gravity combat racer and one of the most underrated racing games on Steam.</p>
